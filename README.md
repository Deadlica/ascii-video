# ascii-video

A video converter that converts .mp4 files into ASCII characters graphic, it can also play the audio with .ogg files

This project is a modified version of IonelPopJara's work, whereas this one is made for linux and uses the SFML library in addition to OPENCV to play the audio.

# Setup
To run the program make sure to have OPENCV and SFML installed, then have the .mp4 file in the same directory as the executable program. Optionally you can add a .ogg file for audio, make sure it has the same name as the .mp4 file.
